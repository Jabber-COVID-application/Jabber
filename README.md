## Installing the Project

You will need to first install:

- Node.js
- Yarn

To install the project dependencies, execute the command `yarn` in the root directory, then again in both the `client`
and `api` directories.

To configure the project, edit values in the .env and config files.

## Running the Project

To run either component of the project (client or api), look at the `package.json` of each and view the scripts
available.

Run the scripts by using `yarn run <script>` while in the same directory as the `package.json`.

If you have any issues, let me know.
